<h2 class="page-title">Editorial Illustration: Free Speech</h2>
<p class="about-image">An editorial illustration created for Algonquin
Collegeâ€™s Glue Magazine, specifically for an article on the topic of free speech. The message of the article comes across in a powerful way through the image, both from the action of the mouth being sewn shut, thus not allowing it to speak, and from the expression in the eyes. Colour is used sparingly, only to put further emphasis on the two areas.</p>
