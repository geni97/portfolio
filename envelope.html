des: Geni loves wildflowers and she loves getting and sending mail (real mail). So she combined them in an illustration.

<h2 class="page-title">Send Me Wildflowers</h2>
<p class="about-image">A line illustration drawn first by hand and then digitally. My line illustrations are created to have a hand-drawn look and feel, with lines creating all the shapes and textures. The colours used in Send Me Wildflowers are muted tones, and are applied with a simple, solid look allowing the lines to do all the work.</p>
