<h2 class="page-title">Icon Design</h2>
<p class="about-image">Four sets of icons all created with vector line work. General website icons, medical icons, breakfast icons and communication icons. These icon sets are simple and clean, yet have some added character in the form of little bits of texture and lines that make them stand out from others. </p>
