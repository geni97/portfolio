<h2 class="page-title">Otherwise Engaged</h2>
<p class="about-image">Illustrations and puns together? What more could anyone want? This simple line illustration is a literal take on the expression “otherwise engaged”. Only one colour is used, in a lighter and darker shade, and it’s the perfect amount of colour. It’s an illustration that doesn’t need more than that.</p>
