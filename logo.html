<h2 class="page-title">Logo Redesign</h2>
<p class="about-image">My redesigned version of the Pure Gelato logo. Pure Gelato is a local shop that sells wonderful gelato. It needed a logo that could represent exactly how great it is. So I designed one. Fresh colours, simple design, inviting but modern. Exactly like the store itself, and exactly like the product, of course!</p>
<p class="no">(This was a project, not a real redesign for the company)</p>
