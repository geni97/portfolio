Hi! I'm Geni Triantis, Graphic Designer and Illustrator. I think the way your surroundings look can affect the way you feel more than you would imagine. That's always been the case for me. I feel best when I'm inspired by what I see around me and that's one of the reasons I'm a graphic designer. So I can help make the world a more inspirational place in my own, tiny way. By making things look good, and creating things that make people feel inspired.
